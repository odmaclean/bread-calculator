# bread-calculator

This code is for an R Shiny app to calculate ingredient amounts for sourdough recipes, using baker's math and adjustable percentages of different flours.

There is also a Desired Dough Temperature calculator, used to control the dough temperature after mixing and have consistent fermentation.

The app runs at https://sourdoughcalculator.shinyapps.io/calculator/ (as of Feb 2022 and hopefully ongoing, unless RStudio changes their hosting plan.)
